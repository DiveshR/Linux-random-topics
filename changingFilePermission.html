changing File Permissions

1. Absolute (Numeric) Mode

0 for no permission
1 for execute
2 for write
4 for read

764 
Note: using 764 it will overwite the previous permission.

7 indicates Read+write+execute(rwx) 4+2+1=7 for user.
6 indicates Read+write(rw-) 4+2=6 for Group
4 indicates Read(r--) 4 for others


2. Symbolic Mode (for all 3 user types)

Note: using Symbolic mode you can add, remove or overrides the Permissions just like Absolute mode.
We uses characters instead of numbers.
